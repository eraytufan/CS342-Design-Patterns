The program has 3 different characters to choose from. They are human, elf and dwarf.
There are also 3 different weapons sword, bow and staff.
Both weapons and characters have different attributes. Characters inherit from character class
and weapons inherit from weapon class. 

There are 3 tests. Battle test, speed test and intelligence test. 

Battle test uses 2 threads to attack. Random value is added to hit point to change the outcome of the test.
So depending on the chances, even though it is low, less stronger character win the battle.

In intelligence test, if character has better intelligence the question gets easier. Intelligence test
is math questions.

In speed test, user has to write a sentence in given time. If character has better speed, then user
has more time to type the sentence making test easier.
